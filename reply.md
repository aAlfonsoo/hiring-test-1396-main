Hi Alice,

Sorry for the inconvenience you're experiencing.

I looked into the issue and noticed that when I pinged site.recruitment.shq.nz, it resolved to 192.168.1.10 instead of the expected IP address, 223.165.64.38. I checked, and 223.165.64.38 is reachable, whereas 192.168.1.10 is not.

This suggests there might be a problem with the DNS settings. It seems the DNS records for site.recruitment.shq.nz might not be directing traffic to the correct IP address.

We're on it and will start working to fix any DNS issues to get your site up and running smoothly as soon as possible.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention. Feel free to reach out if you have any more questions or need further assistance.

Best,
SiteHost
